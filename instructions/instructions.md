## Welcome!

Steps:

1. As you complete engagements, report your engagements to Kevin Malone in your discord server using the /report command!
2. When you click through to the link, if you don't see your name as an option to select from, go back to discord and make sure you've already run the /join command.
3. And that's it! We'll send you the movement model report on Monday of the next week.
4. If you ever want to see the points you've earned from the previous weeks, you can read through the Actitvity History Folder and find your engagements!
