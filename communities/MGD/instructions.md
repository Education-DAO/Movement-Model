## Welcome MGD!

Steps:
1. Each Friday, fill out the activity that happened in the last week (Sat - Fri). [Here's the template.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/143f6Sf_3_uo1Jb5m7tnuJi3t4UCYmTdXYNh8Im3lLhM/edit#gid=1296971759)
2. Download that week's sheet as a csv.
3. Push the csv to the MGD folder [(here)](https://github.com/christinevandev/Movement-Proposals/tree/main/communities/MGD) with naming convention mgd_8_20.
4. That's it! We'll send you the movement model report on Monday.
