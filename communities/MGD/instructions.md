## Welcome MGD!

Steps:
1. Each Friday, fill out the activity that happened in the last week (Sat - Fri). [Here's the template.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/143f6Sf_3_uo1Jb5m7tnuJi3t4UCYmTdXYNh8Im3lLhM/edit#gid=1296971759)
2. Please add new members as rows in the 'Membership' tab and make any applicable updates to missing fields here. This info should autopopulate to the template for that week.
3. Please delete the non-lead-id ID columns before submitting.
4. Download that week's sheet as a csv.
5. Push the csv to the MGD folder [(here)](https://github.com/christinevandev/Movement-Proposals/tree/main/communities/MGD) with naming convention mgd_8_27.
6. That's it! We'll send you the movement model report on Monday.
