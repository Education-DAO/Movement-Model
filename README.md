# Movement-Proposals
Place where leaders and users can come together to collaborate on open source policy for an outcome community to vote on

### Process
1. For this given issue, navigate to the desired outcome
2. Ensure you've pledged as a "loot holder" to a given DAO that represents the outcome you want to see
3. If you're a selected politician, please submit a proposal or propose changes to an existing proposal
4. If you're not a selected politician, please leave comments on different proposals so politicians can take into account feedback from community
5. After two weeks, we will put all submitted proposals on snapshot for a vote.  At that time, users can vote on the proposal that they are most excited about.
6. The proposal that receives the most votes will be the proposal this groups submits to your Community
7. The politicians who submitted the winning proposal will receive 20% of the amount raised, the other 80% will be held in escrow to be delivered to your Community Fund upon completion of the proposal
